Gross RE

0.0.1 - 2016-03-04

Pronounced the same as Grocery.  I just got tired of spelling grocerie all the time.  Groseree, groserie, growsiree ...  It's gross...

This is something I've had in the back of my mind for a while.  I wanted to write a grocery planning application that can 'predict' your grocery needs.  I did a very basic version of this as part of another project 10 years ago in Delphi.  Back when I thought Delphi was the best thing since Generics. 

Oh, wait, I had to use a TList.  OK, best thing since Auto Memory Cleanup.  

No, MemTest.pas had to be added to make sure I cleaned up all my created objects.  OK, best thing since...

Well, string handling in Delphi was pretty damn fast.  And you could produce Windows Services and Screen Savers.

In any case, 10 years later we have a bunch of new flavours of the decade.

This project will be my personal entry into the following categories:
- Docker (including managing the cloud host)
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data Rest - Including HATEyOAS and HAL
- ~~AngularJS~~  React.js 
- HTML5 (gonna take Bootstrap for a spin)

For now this is purely a self-serving project.  The only reason it's on a public repo on Github is because I don't want to pay for a private one.
